# Puckepy

A library to describe and characterise molecules, `written in Rust btw`

- `puckepy.formalism` to describe molecules quantitatively through various puckering formalisms
- `puckepy.confsampling` to provide the functionality from [pucke.rs](https://github.com/jrihon/puckers) in `Python`
- `puckepy.geometry` to describe molecules by elementary geometrical attributes

## Documentation
- Online documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/jrihon/puckepy/blob/main/docs/documentation.md) !

- The repository has been annotated with python stubs `.pyi` and should autocomplete with the proper `Language Server Protocol (LSP)`. This also allows for the `LSP` to show documentation when calling classes and methods, when using `puckepy` in your preferred text editor.

## Installation
- Installation protocol can be found [here](https://github.com/jrihon/puckepy/blob/main/docs/installation.md) !
